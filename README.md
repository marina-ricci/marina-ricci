### ðŸ‘‰ About me

Iâ€™m an observational cosmologist, analyzing the large scale structures of the Universe to better understand its evolution and the underlying laws of physics. I am particularly interested in the most massive bound structures in our Universe : Galaxy Clusters. I use data from different instruments at different wavelengths to characterize them, and better understand their physics. In the past years I was mostly focus in the preparation of the cosmological analyses of the Vera C. Rubin Observatory data.

###  ðŸ”­ Collaborations and projects
- I am deeply involved in the [Dark Energy Science Collaboration (DESC)](https://lsstdesc.org/) of the Vera C. Rubin Large Synoptic Survey of Space and Time (LSST). I'm also currently part of the comissioning team for the [Rubin Observatory](https://rubinobservatory.org/). 
- I was involved in the XMM-Newton [XXL Survey](https://irfu.cea.fr/en/Phocea/Vie_des_labos/Ast/ast_technique.php?id_ast=3015), and Iâ€™m now part of its successor, the [FornaX project](https://fornax.cosmostat.org/presentation/scientific-goals/).
- I'm also part of the [Euclid consortium](https://www.euclid-ec.org/).
- I was PI of an observational follow-up project with the NIKA2 camera in the millimeter wavelength, that started during my PhD [see papers 1 ](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.07866)[and 2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05819). 
- I am now part of the [AstroDeep](https://astrodeep.net/) team, dedicated to the development of deep learning technics for large scale structure cosmology.
